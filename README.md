# Cover Letter and CV Tailoring

This application is designed to assist users in customizing their CVs and Cover Letters for specific job applications. Users input their CV, a model Cover Letter, and the job offer text to receive tailored versions of both documents. Currently under development, the app utilizes NLTK, Transformers, Spacy, and the OpenAI API to generate high-quality cover letters and apply advanced techniques for CV customization.

The project aims to deliver professionally tailored CVs and Cover Letters that enhance the likelihood of securing job interviews. It currently operates using a model CV and cover letter, requiring users to update these templates to align with their own experiences and qualifications.

Future plans include expanding the application into a web-based platform to improve accessibility and user experience, making it easier for job seekers to use and customize their application materials effectively.

To set up the environment, install these libraries using pip:
```python
pip install openai pandas python-docx spacy
python tailoring.py
